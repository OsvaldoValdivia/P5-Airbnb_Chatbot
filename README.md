# Description 
This project involves creating an automated Airbnb bot capable of answering location-specific inquiries. Implemented in a live environment using real data, the bot responds to questions about accommodations via WhatsApp using the official Meta API. It leverages Airbnb data to provide instant responses regarding various aspects of a location, enhancing user interaction and engagement on the messaging platform.
